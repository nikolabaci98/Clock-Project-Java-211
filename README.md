# Clock-Project-Java-211

This project opens a input file with a list of times. It then stores these times in a binary tree which are sorted using a Comparable interface.
The file is chosen using GUI where I incoorporate ActionListening interface. Also, the project supports ClockExceptions to handle wrong clock formats.

#### Input file format hh:mm:ss

#### Reflection
This is the last project in a sequence of four in total. The knowledge is build graudally during the Spring 2019 semester. The easest part is creating the class with all its members. The hardest part was the Event Handler which I found trick to follow it schematiclly, however I eventually figured it out.

#### Improvements
The code is desigened  during the semester and I strongly belive that it needs to be cleaned. It might include deleteing some unnecessary comments, changing the names of some funtions and extracting new, smaller funtions from complex ones.
